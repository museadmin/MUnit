=========================================================================

MUnit is a Unit Test Harness, modelled on the likes of JUnit, in that it
supports assertions and test definitions. While capable of testing 
sophisticated bash applications such as the MUSE Automation Harness, see -
https://github.com/museadmin/muse - MUnit has been developed with simplicity 
in mind:

    * Designed to be self contained and deployable from a simple 
    tar archive. 
    * Simple to extend with custom assertions.
    * Familiar JUnit Test Style reporting.
    * Helpful options to assist the developer.
